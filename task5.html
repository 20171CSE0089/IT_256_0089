Bangalore, officially known as Bengaluru[14] ([ˈbeŋɡəɭuːɾu] (About this soundlisten)), is the capital of the Indian state of Karnataka. It has a population of over ten million,[8] making it a megacity and the third-most populous city and fifth-most populous urban agglomeration in India.[15] It is located in southern India, on the Deccan Plateau at an elevation of over 900 m (3,000 ft) above sea level, which is the highest among India's major cities.[16] Its multi-ethnic, multi-religious, and cosmopolitan character is reflected by its more than 1000 Hindu temples, 400 mosques, 100 churches, 40 Jain Basadis, three Sikh gurdwaras, two Buddhist viharas and one Parsi fire temple located in an area of 741 km² of the metropolis. The religious places are further represented by the proposed Chabad of the Jewish community. The numerous Bahá'ís have a society called the Bahá'í Centre.

In 1537 CE, Kempé Gowdā – a feudal ruler under the Vijayanagara Empire – established a mud fort considered to be the foundation of modern Bengaluru and its oldest areas, or petes, which exist to the present day. After the fall of Vijayanagar empire in 16th century, the Mughals sold Bangalore to Chikkadevaraja Wodeyar (1673–1704), the then ruler of the Kingdom of Mysore for three lakh rupees.[17] When Haider Ali seized control of the Kingdom of Mysore, the administration of Bangalore passed into his hands. It was captured by the British East India Company after victory in the Fourth Anglo-Mysore War (1799), who returned administrative control of the city to the Maharaja of Mysore. The old city developed in the dominions of the Maharaja of Mysore and was made capital of the Princely State of Mysore, which existed as a nominally sovereign entity of the British Raj.

In 1809, the British shifted their cantonment to Bangalore, outside the old city, and a town grew up around it, which was governed as part of British India. Following India's independence in 1947, Bangalore became the capital of Mysore State, and remained capital when the new Indian state of Karnataka was formed in 1956. The two urban settlements of Bangalore – city and cantonment – which had developed as independent entities merged into a single urban centre in 1949. The existing Kannada name, Bengalūru, was declared the official name of the city in 2006.

Bengaluru is sometimes referred to as the "Silicon Valley of India" (or "IT capital of India") because of its role as the nation's leading information technology (IT) exporter.[1][18][19] Indian technological organisations ISRO, Infosys, Wipro and HAL are headquartered in the city. A demographically diverse city, Bangalore is the second fastest-growing major metropolis in India.[20] Bengaluru has one of the most highly educated workforces in the world.[21] It is home to many educational and research institutions, such as Indian Institute of Science (IISc), Indian Institute of Management (Bangalore) (IIMB), International Institute of Information Technology, Bangalore (IIITB), National Institute of Fashion Technology, Bangalore, National Institute of Design, Bangalore (NID R&D Campus), National Law School of India University (NLSIU) and National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS). Numerous state-owned aerospace and defence organisations, such as Bharat Electronics, Hindustan Aeronautics and National Aerospace Laboratories are located in the city. Mysore Sandal Soap is produced in this city. The city also houses the Kannada film industry also called Sandalwood.

Web Data Mining Based on Cloud-computing
CHENG Miao(School of Management,University of Science and Technology of China,Hefei 230026,China)  
Internet is a huge and widely distributed information service center,the vast amounts of data generated on the Internet are usually geographically distributed,heterogeneous,dynamic and become more complex,it can not meet the requirements if we use the existing centralized data mining methods.To solve these problems,proposed a cloud computing-based Web data mining method,the massive data and mining tasks will be decomposed on multiple computers paral-lely processed.We use open platform——Hadoop to establish a parallel association rules mining algorithm based on Apriori,and it tests and veriftes the efficiency of system.This paper proposed a design thinking that "migrate the calculation to the store",the calculation will be implemented on the local storage nodes,thus it can avoid the large amount of data transmission on the network,and will not take a lot of bandwidth.
